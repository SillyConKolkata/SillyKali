# SillyKali
Kali 2017.1 SDCARD IMG for CubieBoard2 based on Ambian , Debian, Kali 2017.1 and Linux-SunXI 

Default Login Details

login: root
password: toor

SSH is default enabled. IP will be assigned by DHCP of the network. Check your Router Web Interface to determine the IP.

You can also connect to X11 interface ( LXDE ) . But, found VNC is not a good solution for me. 
So, it is preinstalled with "NoMachine" server.

Download NoMachine client from https://www.nomachine.com/download and use the provided login details to use LXDE remotely.

PS: Having trouble to upload the BIG image file to github. Here is the download link from Mega
